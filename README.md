# 🛠️ ETL with Python

Welcome to the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) with Python** repository! This project showcases various **ETL pipelines** designed to process and manage data using Python's powerful libraries. These pipelines are aimed at automating the extraction of data from different sources, transforming it for analysis, and loading it into a target destination, such as a database or data warehouse.

## 🚀 Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build and manage ETL processes using Python, focusing on the following key tasks:
- **Extraction**: Gather raw data from various formats (CSV, JSON, APIs, etc.).
- **Transformation**: Clean, format, and structure the data for analysis or storage.
- **Loading**: Insert the cleaned and structured data into a final destination, such as a database.

This repository is perfect for anyone looking to learn or improve their ETL skills with Python.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each ETL pipeline is organized as follows:
```
├── data/                    # Raw data sources and transformed data
├── notebooks/               # Jupyter notebooks for interactive ETL processes
├── src/                     # Python scripts for each step of the ETL process
│   ├── extract.py           # Code for extracting data from different sources
│   ├── transform.py         # Data transformation and cleaning
│   └── load.py              # Loading data into target destinations
├── config/                  # Configuration files for API keys, database connections, etc.
├── results/                 # Logs, performance reports, and outputs
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SyedSubhan12/ETL-with-Python.git
   cd ETL-with-Python
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up configuration**:
   - Add your **API keys** or **database credentials** in the `config/` folder.

## 🔍 Example Projects

### 1. 🛒 **E-Commerce Data ETL Pipeline**
   - **Goal**: Extract sales data from a CSV file, clean and transform the data, and load it into an SQL database.
   - **Tools**: Pandas, SQLAlchemy.
   - **Steps**:
     - Extract raw sales data from the `data/` folder.
     - Clean the data (handle missing values, fix data types, etc.).
     - Load the data into a PostgreSQL database.

### 2. 🌦️ **Weather Data API ETL Pipeline**
   - **Goal**: Extract real-time weather data from a public API, transform it for analytics, and load it into a CSV file.
   - **Tools**: Requests, JSON, Pandas.
   - **Steps**:
     - Extract data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
     - Transform and aggregate the data for daily and hourly analysis.
     - Save the transformed data as a CSV file.

### 3. 🧹 **Data Cleaning Pipeline for CSV Files**
   - **Goal**: Automate the data cleaning process for large CSV files with missing or inconsistent data.
   - **Tools**: Pandas.
   - **Steps**:
     - Extract the raw data from the `data/` folder.
     - Apply various cleaning techniques (imputation, normalization, deduplication).
     - Load the cleaned data into a new CSV file for further analysis.
